# Code of Conduct

The NTNT community is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

We adopt and follow these community standards:

### Contributor Covenant v1.3.0

We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v1.3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct/), which establishes baseline expectations for respectful participation in open source communities.

### Citizen Code of Conduct

We adopt the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md), which emphasizes creating a positive environment where everyone can participate and contribute.

### Policy on Trolling

We follow [Isaac Z. Schlueter's Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling), originally written for the Node.js/npm community. The key principle: **"Don't be a jerk."**

## Summary

In short:

- **Be respectful** - Treat everyone with dignity
- **Be constructive** - Focus on improving the project
- **Be inclusive** - Welcome newcomers and diverse perspectives
- **Don't troll** - If you're not here to help, don't participate

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all NTNT project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Community chat channels
