# Intent Programming Language

Intent is a revolutionary programming language and ecosystem designed specifically for AI-driven development. Unlike traditional languages built for human developers, Intent empowers AI agents as primary software creators while maintaining deep human oversight and collaboration.

## Overview

Intent reimagines software development for an era where AI agents handle the heavy lifting of coding, testing, and deployment. The language features:

- **First-Class Contracts**: Design-by-contract principles built into the syntax for guaranteed correctness
- **Typed Error Effects**: Explicit error handling and failure conditions
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatic API compatibility management
- **Structured Edits**: AST-based code manipulation for safe refactoring
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Built-in support for AI agents working together
- **Human-in-the-Loop Governance**: Transparent decision-making with human approval gates

## Vision

Intent bridges the gap between AI's speed and consistency with human judgment and design sense. The ecosystem includes:

- Integrated development workflows (CI/CD, reviews, pull requests)
- Rich observability and explainability features
- Formal concurrency protocols
- UI/UX constraint declarations
- Intent encoding for self-documenting code

## Getting Started

This repository contains the whitepaper and initial specifications for the Intent language. Future development will include:

- Language specification and compiler
- Standard library
- Development tools and IDE support
- Example projects and use cases

## Documentation

- [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md) - Complete technical specification and motivation
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design and components
- [Language Spec](LANGUAGE_SPEC.md) - Formal language definition

## Contributing

Intent is an open-source project welcoming contributions from developers, language designers, and AI researchers. See our contributing guidelines for details.
