    <h2>Introducing NTNT: A Programming Language for the AI Era</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">January 15, 2026 - NTNT Team</div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>We're excited to introduce NTNT (pronounced "Intent"), a new programming language designed from the ground up for AI-assisted software development.</p>

        <h3>A Real Programming Language</h3>

        <p>NTNT is not a toy or a DSL. It's a full-featured language with everything you need to build real applications:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modern type system</strong> - Generics, enums, pattern matching, structs, and traits</li>
            <li><strong>Design by contract</strong> - <code>requires</code> and <code>ensures</code> clauses built into the syntax</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive stdlib</strong> - HTTP server/client, PostgreSQL, JSON, CSV, file I/O, crypto, and concurrency</li>
            <li><strong>No package manager needed</strong> - Batteries included, just import and use</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Makes NTNT Different?</h3>

        <p>Traditional languages were designed for humans typing code character by character. NTNT is designed for a world where AI agents generate code and humans verify it works correctly.</p>

        <p>The key innovation is <strong>Intent-Driven Development (IDD)</strong>:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Write requirements in plain language <code>.intent</code> files</li>
            <li>Link code to requirements with <code>@implements</code> annotations</li>
            <li>Run <code>ntnt intent check</code> to verify they match</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This creates full traceability from requirement to implementation. You can always answer: "What is this code supposed to do?" and "Does it actually do that?"</p>

        <h3>Developer Experience</h3>

        <p>We've focused on making NTNT a joy to use:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Native hot-reload</strong> - HTTP servers automatically reload when you save. No restart needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Intent Studio</strong> - Visual development environment with live test execution</li>
            <li><strong>Single binary</strong> - No runtime dependencies, runs anywhere</li>
            <li><strong>Agent-native tooling</strong> - <code>ntnt inspect</code> outputs structured JSON for AI agents</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Should Use NTNT?</h3>

        <p>NTNT is experimental and not production-ready. It's a great fit for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Exploring AI-assisted development workflows</li>
            <li>Prototypes and proof-of-concepts</li>
            <li>Learning about contracts and formal specifications</li>
            <li>Internal tools where you control the environment</li>
        </ul>
