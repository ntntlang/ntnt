        <p>Welcome to the official blog for the NTNT programming language!</p>

        <p>NTNT (pronounced "Intent") is an experimental programming language designed for AI-assisted software development. It introduces Intent-Driven Development (IDD), where human requirements become executable specifications that AI agents implement and the system verifies.</p>

        <h3>What Makes NTNT Different?</h3>

        <p>Traditional programming languages were designed for humans typing code character by character. As AI agents become capable of generating software, the requirements shift:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agents need structured validation</strong> - machine-readable contracts and introspection</li>
            <li><strong>Humans need intent clarity</strong> - understand what code should do without reading every line</li>
            <li><strong>Both need traceability</strong> - connect requirements to implementation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        <p>Check out the <a href="/learn">Learn</a> page to get started with NTNT, or visit our <a href="https://github.com/ntntlang/ntnt">GitHub repository</a> for the source code and documentation.</p>

        <p>Remember: NTNT is experimental and not ready for production use. We are exploring ideas at the intersection of programming languages and AI assistance.</p>
