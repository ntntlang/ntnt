        <p>Intent-Driven Development (IDD) is a methodology where human requirements are written as structured intent files, code is annotated with implementation markers, and the system verifies that implementations match their intents.</p>

        <h3>The IDD Workflow</h3>

        <p>IDD follows a simple cycle:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Human writes intent</strong> - Describe what the software should do in a <code>.intent</code> file</li>
            <li><strong>Agent implements</strong> - AI generates code with <code>@implements</code> annotations</li>
            <li><strong>System verifies</strong> - <code>ntnt intent check</code> confirms the implementation matches</li>
            <li><strong>Human reviews</strong> - Approve, refine intent, or request changes</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why Intent Files?</h3>

        <p>Intent files serve multiple purposes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They are human-readable specifications that do not require reading code</li>
            <li>They are machine-parseable, so agents know exactly what to build</li>
            <li>They create a permanent record of requirements separate from implementation</li>
            <li>They enable automatic verification that code does what it should</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Traceability</h3>

        <p>Every function can be traced back to its intent. Run <code>ntnt intent coverage</code> to see which intents have implementations and which are missing. This makes it easy to audit a codebase and understand its purpose.</p>
