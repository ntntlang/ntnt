    <h2>Intent-Driven Development: From Requirements to Verified Code</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">January 10, 2026 - NTNT Team</div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Intent-Driven Development (IDD) is a methodology where human requirements become executable specifications. You write what your software should do, the system verifies that your code actually does it.</p>

        <h3>A Concrete Example</h3>

        <p>Let's say you're building a greeting API. First, write an intent file describing what it should do:</p>

        <pre><code># server.intent

Feature: User Greeting
  id: feature.greeting
  description: "Display a personalized greeting"

  Scenario: Greet by name
    When: GET /?name=Alice
    Then:
      - status 200
      - body contains "Hello, Alice"

  Scenario: Default greeting
    When: GET /
    Then:
      - status 200
      - body contains "Hello, World"</code></pre>

        <p>Now implement it in NTNT, linking your code to the intent:</p>

        <pre><code>// server.tnt
import { html } from "std/http/server"

// @implements: feature.greeting
fn home(req) {
    let name = req.query_params["name"] ?? "World"
    return html("&lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;")
}

get("/", home)
listen(8080)</code></pre>

        <p>Run <code>ntnt intent check server.tnt</code> and the system automatically:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Starts your server</li>
            <li>Makes the HTTP requests defined in scenarios</li>
            <li>Verifies the assertions pass</li>
            <li>Reports results</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

        <p>Traditional development has a gap between requirements and code. Requirements live in documents that quickly become outdated. Tests verify behavior but don't explain intent. Code comments try to bridge the gap but are often ignored.</p>

        <p>IDD closes this gap:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirements are executable</strong> - They're not just documentation, they're tests</li>
            <li><strong>Code is traceable</strong> - Every function links back to its requirement</li>
            <li><strong>Changes are verifiable</strong> - Modify code, run check, know if you broke anything</li>
            <li><strong>AI agents have clear targets</strong> - Tell an agent to implement <code>feature.greeting</code> and it knows exactly what success looks like</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Intent Studio: Visual Development</h3>

        <p>For the best experience, use Intent Studio:</p>

        <pre><code>ntnt intent studio server.intent</code></pre>

        <p>This opens a visual interface at <code>http://127.0.0.1:3001</code> showing your intent file with live pass/fail indicators. As you edit your code, tests re-run automatically and you see results update in real-time.</p>

        <h3>Design by Contract Integration</h3>

        <p>IDD works hand-in-hand with NTNT's contract system. Contracts define function-level specifications:</p>

        <pre><code>fn withdraw(amount: Int) -> Int
    requires amount > 0
    requires amount <= self.balance
    ensures result >= 0
{
    self.balance = self.balance - amount
    return self.balance
}</code></pre>

        <p>In HTTP routes, contract violations automatically return proper error responses: failed preconditions return 400 Bad Request, failed postconditions return 500 Internal Server Error.</p>
